This repository contains a small CLI project written in Scala which takes a list of items
and determines a price. This calculation takes into account any discounts which may be on offer.

The current items "in stock" are:
- Soup (65p)
- Bread (80p)
- Milk (£1.30)
- Apples (£1.00)

Discounts on offer:
- 10% off Apples (if Discount Week is True)
- 50% off 1 Bread for every 2 Soups you buy

The source code can be seen in PriceBasket.scala.
